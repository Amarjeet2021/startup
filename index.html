                1. Leaves to Life is a community-driven startup with a specific mission of preventing road accidents resulting from slippery roads 
                and masked potholes or hidden obstacles due to fallen leaves. <br> <br>
                2. Our approach involves gathering these fallen leaves from the roads and
                converting them into valuable compost, often referred to as 'brown gold.'<br> <br>
                3. We then distribute this compost to our registered members and make it available for sale at an
                affordable price, promoting sustainability and road safety.

               1. Our goal is to significantly reduce winter and 
                 monsoon road accidents in India caused by fallen leaves by 50% or more. <br> <br>
                2. We aim to achieve this by making affordable compost readily accessible. 
                This not only promotes road safety but also offers farmers the
                 opportunity to embrace organic farming practices. <br> <br>
                3. we provide a platform for farmers to sell their organically grown vegetables
                  to local communities

            <h2 class="heading">Why LTL ?</h2>
            <p > 
                The moisture and fallen leaves on roadways is deadly combination as it makes the roads slippery and
                mask the potholes and other obstacles on the road. 
                This is a significant contributor to winter road accidents. <br> <br>
                Soil is the foundation of all life, but we are damaging it by using
                too much fertilizers and pesticides. we only have about 100 crop cycles left that means only for 40-50 years ,
                Forest soil has an organic content of 70%, while agricultural soil should have an organic content of 3-6%. However, <br> <br>
                more than 60% of India's agricultural soil has an organic content of less than 0.5%.
                we are providing valuable compost to farmers at cheaper cost so they can transit from chemical farming to organic farming 
                organic farming provide more value <br>
                creating employment for both
                <span>skilled</span> as well <span>unskilled</span> people <br> 
                LTL  will added value to the lives of the field workers who are predominantly small and marginalised farmers. <br>
                Young boys and girls in search of jobs from villages will become our workforce.
